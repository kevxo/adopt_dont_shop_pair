*Project:* Adopt Don't Shop Paired

*Group Member Names:* Joshua Carey and Kevin Cuadros

*Previous  Feedback:*
Joshua:
- slow down and delegate

Kevin:
- A point where he should be asking more questions.
- Can get in a pretty heavy workflow and not want to take a break.
- Would get frustrated when couldn't find an immediate solution and would not want to take a break.

*Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):*  

Joshua:
- Improve following RESTful conventions
- Make testing more robust to include edge cases (sad path)
  - particularly with model testing
- Get comfortable using more robust AR queries

Kevin:
- To be able to better explain MVC,
- Better explain what the models are doing
- Improve understanding with AR and be able to better explain what it is doing.
- Wants both of us to be able to explain the code for entire project.


*Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):*

Joshua:
strengths:
Preferred collaboration:
- divide and conquer with frequent check-ins

Kevin:
Strengths: problem solving, work ethic
Preferred collaboration:
- Driver/navigator for parts where content is not understood or content is more complex
- Otherwise ok with divide and conquer  

Our strategy:
- combination of divide and conquer and driver/navigator
- depend on the complexity of the user story

*Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):*  

Joshua:
M-F: Cut off time is 9pm
Thursday: May be offline between 6 pm to 8pm
S-Su:
Saturday: 8am - whenever
Sunday: 8 am - 3 pm (offline afterwords)

Kevin:
M-F: Cut off time is 9pm
S-Su: Start around 10 am (MST), work until whenever

Both:
Regularly-scheduled check-ins: 5 pm to 7 pm (MST)
- user story assignment and driver/navigator
- keep open communication throughout slack, and can communicate questions/help needed
- If necessary can jump on ad hoc zoom calls
- Can use Thursday as study day

*Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):*

Joshua:
- feeling iffy with app structure and need to reference notes often
- Growth area: feeling more confident and can build app with little reference to notes

Kevin: feeling more confident with testing
- feeling a little shaky with app structure  

*Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):*

We will figure this out as we go during our check-ins.

*Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):*

GH norms:
1. Around equal number of commits for each (around the same number of user stories)
  - Commit after each story is completed

1. Make sure to never work on main branch
1. Never merge your own PR
1. Summarize what the PR does when you submit it
1. Make sure to provide at least 1 comment before merging PR
1. Branching:
  - Each user story is its own branch
  - Submit PRs to user story dev branch (for each section)
  - Once all user stories are completed for a section submit PR to main
  - Anytime we merge into main, we will push to heroku

1. Communicate via Slack when a PR is submitted
1. Review and comment PR within 12 hours
1. Assign user stories through project management tool on GH

*Pomodoro Break Schedule:*

Be cognizant of the need for a break, but no explicitly scheduled breaks to allow for a cohesive workflow.

*Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:*  

Joshua/Kevin:
technical: can provide within the PR comments
interpersonal: be through slack, or zoom, with why explanation, always with respect
- provide constructive feedback with alternative solutions
- address sources of conflict in real-time with above considerations
- make sure each of us understands before moving on 


*Additional Remote Considerations:*

*Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):*

- GH project management
